# **Analytics Service**

## **Overview**
The `analytics` service is a dedicated microservice in the microservices architecture designed to provide advanced data analysis and visualization capabilities. It leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret natural language queries, retrieve data from other microservices or a centralized database, and produce meaningful insights in the form of tables, graphs, and charts.

This service is primarily aimed at empowering both users and administrators with the ability to:
- Query the system using natural language for insights.
- Visualize key performance metrics, such as revenue trends, product sales, and user engagement.

## **Features**
### **1. Natural Language Query Processing**
- Accepts queries in plain English, such as:
  - *"What was the total revenue last month?"*
  - *"Show me the top-selling products for the last quarter."*
- Converts these queries into database-compatible statements using LLMs.

### **2. Data Retrieval and Aggregation**
- Aggregates data from:
  - Microservices like `product-service`, `user-service`, and `payment-service`.
  - A centralized data lake or data warehouse (if available).

### **3. Data Visualization**
- Generates user-friendly visualizations, including:
  - Revenue charts (line/bar charts).
  - Product performance tables.
  - Customer trends and engagement metrics.
- Visualization tools: **Plotly**, **Matplotlib**, or **D3.js** (configurable).

### **4. Role-Based Insights**
- **Admins**: Access detailed operational metrics (e.g., revenue breakdown, user analytics).
- **Users**: Access personalized insights (e.g., purchase history, spending trends).

### **5. Security and Validation**
- Input validation to ensure safe and accurate database queries.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict data access.

## **Architecture**
### **Key Components**
1. **LLM Integration**
   - Uses OpenAI, Hugging Face, or other frameworks for query processing.
2. **Query Builder**
   - Dynamically generates SQL or API queries based on user input.
3. **Data Aggregator**
   - Gathers and normalizes data from microservices or external databases.
4. **Visualization Engine**
   - Converts raw data into meaningful visual representations.
